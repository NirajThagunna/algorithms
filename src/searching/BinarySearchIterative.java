/* 
 * Defination:
 *		Binary search is a fast search algorithm with run-time complexity of ÎŸ(log n). This search algorithm works on the 
 *		principle of divide and conquer. For this algorithm to work properly, the data collection should be in the sorted form.
 * 		
 * 		The time complexity of the binary search algorithm is O(log n). 
 * 		The best-case time complexity would be O(1) when the central index would directly match the desired value. 
 * 		The worst-case scenario could be the values at either extremity of the list or values not in the list.
 * 
 * 		The space complexity of the binary search algorithm depends on the implementation of the algorithm.
 * 			1) Iterative Method
 * 			2) Recursive Method
 * 		Both methods are quite the same, with two differences in implementation. First, there is no loop in the recursive 
 * 		method. Second, rather than passing the new values to the next iteration of the loop, it passes them to the next 
 * 		recursion. In the iterative method, the iterations can be controlled through the looping conditions, while in the 
 * 		recursive method, the maximum and minimum are used as the boundary condition.
 * 
 * Analysis Of Binary Searching Algorithm :
 * 		-> Time Complexity : O(log n)
 * 			- Best Case Time Complexity : O(1) | Big-Omega
 * 			- Worst Case Time Complexity : O(log n)
 * 			- Average Case Time Complexity : O(log n)
 * 
 * 		-> Space Complexity : O(1)
 * 		-> In the iterative method, the space complexity would be O(1).
