1) what is asymptotic notations?
	-> The word asymptotic means approaching a value or curve arbitrarily closely (i.e. as some sort of limit is taken). 
	-> Asymptotic notations are mathematical tools to represent the time complexity of algorithms for asymptotic analysis.
	
2) Why we use asymptotic notations?
	-> Asymptotic notations allow us to analyze an algorithm's running time by identifying it's behavior as the input size
	   for the algorithm increases. This is also known as algorithm's growth rate.
	   
3) While analysing an algorithm, we mostly consider worst case scenario i.e. Big-Oh (O) notation, because it will give us an
Upper limit of the execution time i.e. the execution time in the worst case.
