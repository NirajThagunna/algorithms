# Java : Algorithms
All the Algorithms are implemented in java.
This is a collection of all the basic and advance Algorithms I am implementing for my educational purpose. The code is optimized and is written to be correct and readable. All the algorithms are tested and, believed to be correct.

## Tests

### Compile
for compiling the program write down:
```
	javac file_name.java
```

### Run
to run the program write down:
```
	java file_name
```
